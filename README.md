Masked face recognition system<br>
Now work on object detection
1. Implemented WIDER validation evaluation on python+Octave;<br>
Prediction results of algorithms located in data/WIDER/pred_(mtcnn)<br>
format: left, top, width, height.<br>
2. Implemented evaluation on Masked Faces Dataset. Currently supported only 1 alg, next time will add support of several algs
